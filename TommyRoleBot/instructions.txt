Install nodejs
cmd directory of bot2.js
cmd node bot2.js
type !rolecall into chat
add emoji to a message
type !fire

problems:
1. doesnt retrieve the right id for rolecallmessage sometimes and just deletes the wrong mesage
2. current emojis are stored by each emoji entry with no user category
3. fire sometimes doesnt do anything
